# RAML Java Parser
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/JoinChat.svg)](https://gitter.im/raml-org/raml-java-parser?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.raml/raml-parser-2/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.raml/raml-parser-2)

This is a Java implementation of a [RAML](http://raml.org) parser for versions [1.0](http://raml.org/raml-10-spec) and [0.8](http://raml.org/raml-08-spec).
The parser depends on SnakeYaml, a Java YAML parser.

The old version that only support RAML 0.8 is still available [here](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/tree/0.8.x).

See http://raml.org for more information about RAML.


## Maven

```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.raml</groupId>
    <artifactId>raml-parser-2</artifactId>
    <version>${raml-parser-version}</version>
  </dependency>
```

### Development version

SNAPSHOT versions are NOT synchronized to Central. If you want to use a snapshot version you need to add the https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/ repository to your pom.xml.

## Build

### JAR file without dependencies

```mvn clean package```

### JAR file with dependencies

```mvn clean package -P jar-with-dependencies```

**Run standalone validator**

```java -jar raml-parser-2-{version}.jar raml-file ...```

### Raml Java Parser JVM Arguments
In order to provide more flexibility, users can set different system properties when parsing different RAML files. Here we list all the system properties you can use right now:

Argument | Description | Default Value
-------- | ----------- | -------------
```yagi.json_duplicate_keys_detection``` | Setting it to true will make the parser fail if any JSON example contains duplicated keys | ```true```
```yagi.disable_anchors``` | Setting it to true will make the parser fail if any JSON example contains an anchor definition | ```false```
```raml.json_schema.fail_on_warning``` | Setting it to true will make the parser fail if any example validated against a particular Json Schema throws a warning message | ```false```

## Usage

```java
RamlModelResult ramlModelResult = new RamlModelBuilder().buildApi(input);
if (ramlModelResult.hasErrors())
{
    for (ValidationResult validationResult : ramlModelResult.getValidationResults())
    {
        System.out.println(validationResult.getMessage());
    }
}
else
{
    Api api = ramlModelResult.getApiV10();

}
```

### Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

### Create issues...

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/issues) before anybody
starts working on it.

### ...but check for existing issues first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to thumb up the original post or add "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

### Merge approval

The maintainers will review your pull request and, if approved, will merge into the main repo. Commits get approval based on the conventions outlined in the previous section. For example, new features without additional tests will be not approved.
